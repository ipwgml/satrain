# Examples

This section provides examples demonstrating the usage of the ``satrain`` package. They can be accessed using the navigation bar on the left. Each example can be downloaded as a Jupyter notebook or executed in Google Colab using the icon on top. 

> **Note**: To run the examples using Google Colab it may be necessary to use the validation split instead of the training split due to memory constraints.
