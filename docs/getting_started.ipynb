    "## Configuring the Data Location\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``satrain`` package expects the data files of the SatRain dataset to be located in a special path called the ``satrain_data_path``.  ``satrain`` does its best to keep track of the data path between subsequent\n",

    "\n",
    "After a fresh install, the ``data_path`` will be initialized to the current working directory from which the first download is invoked.\n",
    "To set an explicit data path, you can use the ``satrain config set_data_path`` command. This will create a ``satrain`` configuration file in the\n",
    "current user's configuration directory, which will allow the setting to persist for subsequent use of the ``satrain`` package. A configuration file storing the\n",
    "``data_path`` will also be created when the first data download is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the ``data_path`` can be set using the ``SATRAIN_DATA_PATH`` environment\n",
    "variable. The path in ``SATRAIN_DATA_PATH`` will overwrite the setting in the user's configuration\n",
    "file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``satrain config show`` command can be used to find out the value of the ``satrain`` data path\n",

    " - ``--subset`` The size of the subset to download. Choose ``xl`` for the full dataset.\n",
    " - ``--splits`` A comma-separated lists of the data splits to download. Available options are ``training``, ``validation``, ``testing``, and ``evaluation``.\n",
    " - ``--geometries`` A comma-separated lists of the data geometries. Available options are ``gridded`` for gridded\n",
    "   observations and ``on_swath`` for the data on the PMW swath.\n",
    " - ``--inputs`` A comma-separated list of the input data to download. Available options are ``ancillary``, ``geo``, ``geo_ir`` and ``pmw``.\n",
    " - ``--formats`` A comma-separated list of the data formats to download. Available options are ``spatial`` for 2D\n",
