# SatRain: A machine-learning-ready benchmark dataset for satellite precipitation estimation

The Satellite Precipitation Retrieval (SatRain) benchmark dataset developed by the
International Precipitation Working Group (IPWG) is a benchmark dataset for
machine-learning-based satellite precipitation retrievals, i.e., algorithms for
detecting and quantifying precipitation from satellite imagery.


## Features

 - Training, validation, and test splits derived from four years of overpasses of passive-microwave sensors
   over the conterminous united states (CONUS)
 - Multi-spectral input observations (microwave, infrared, and visible) from low-earth and geostationary platforms
 - Comprehensive ancillary data covering atmospheric parameters and surface properties
 - Independent *evaluation* datasets derived from independent time periods, regions, and measurement techniques
 - Flexible evaluation framework

## Documentation

For instructions on how to get started using the dataset refer to the documentation available [here](https://satrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).
